GLV - GUI Building Toolkit

Build Instructions
------------------

First of all, edit the config.mk files in ./ and ./test for the appropriate
operating system. By default, everything is configured for Linux.
If you are building under Linux, you need to have development versions of
OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT installed.

Then, in a terminal type:

	make

to build the main library or

	make all

to build the library and test applications.
