GLV - GUI Building Toolkit

Build Instructions
------------------

First of all, edit the file Makefile.config in ./ for the appropriate
operating system. By default, everything is configured for Linux.
If you are building under Linux, you need to have development versions of
OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT installed.

To build the main library, run:

	make

Or, to build the library and test applications, run:

	make all
