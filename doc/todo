- Carbon application focus events need to propagate to the carbon window

- Make event and draw callbacks typesafe. We are currently unsafely casting View *'s.

- Consider removing virtual onResize from Rect to get rid of vtable pointer member.
  There is a potential size anomaly when Rects are packed into another struct.
  This makes it less straightforward to serialize things to disk.

- Make generalized layout classes.

- Anchoring can lead to unexpected behavior when set before adding to a layout

- Text looks bad at positions other than half-integers, e.g. (0, 0) vs. (0.5, 0.5).

- Add more widgets:
	- Rollout (ala GLUI)
		- allows its children to be expanded/collapsed under a title bar.
