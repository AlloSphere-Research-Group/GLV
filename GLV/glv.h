	\section intro_sec Introduction

	GLV (short for Graphics Library of Views) is an OpenGL based GUI library, currently for OSX, 
	Win32, and Linux. The ideal is to create a reasonably efficient, 
	multi-platform API that makes it simple for the end-user developer to 
	create an application's graphical user interface entirely using GPU-based 
	OpenGL instructions, thus freeing CPU resources for other work 
	(e.g. audio DSP).
